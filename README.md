## Description
When you load the landing page, you see the homepage.  Buttons at the top offer links to the homepage, your dashboard, and login.  Here at the home page you can see all users posts.  The login page takes in username and password and compares it to the database, then logs you in as long as your credentials are correct.  From that page there is an option to sign up for an account.  It takes in the same info and creates an account.  Before being logged in, clicking the link to the dashboard automatically forwards you to the login page.  Once logged in, the login button in the header will be replaced with logout, which when clicked will do just that.  The dashboard, when logged in, shows you posts and offeres the ability to create new ones or update/delete your previous posts.
